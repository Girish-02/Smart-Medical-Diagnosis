# Smart Medical Diagnosis

Smart Medical Diagnosis is a project aimed at assisting medical professionals and individuals in diagnosing various medical conditions using medical images. The project utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to classify medical images and provide accurate diagnoses for conditions such as Brain Tumor, Bone Fracture, Kidney Stones, Pneumonia, Eye Infection, and Skin Infection.

## Testing Data Example Images

Here are some example medical images for testing purposes:

- [Brain Tumor](Testing Medical Images Data/Smart Medical Diagnosis testing data/brain tumor yes.jpg)
- [Bone Fracture](Testing Medical Images Data/Smart Medical Diagnosis testing data/bone fracture.jpg)
- [Kidney Stones](Testing Medical Images Data/Smart Medical Diagnosis testing data/kidney yes.jpge)
- [Pneumonia](Testing Medical Images Data/Smart Medical Diagnosis testing data/pnemonia yes.jpeg)
- [Eye Infection](Testing Medical Images Data/Smart Medical Diagnosis testing data/Eye yes.jpg)
